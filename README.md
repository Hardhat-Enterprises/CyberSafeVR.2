**Asset Placement Rule:** Keep shared assets (e.g., CityPeople, OfficeProps) in the root `Assets/` folder.


### Scene Naming and Build Settings

- Place all scene files under `Assets/Scenes/`.  
- Use the format `[FullModuleName][ActivityNumber].unity`.  
  - Example: SafeWebBrowsing01.unity  
  - If multiple scenes for an activity: SafeWebBrowsing01_Office.unity, SafeWebBrowsing01_End.unity  
- Add your scene to **Build Profiles**:  
  - Open the scene in Unity → File → Build Profiles → Add Open Scenes  
  - Do **not** remove existing scenes from the build list.

### Asset Placement/Naming Conventions

- Each module should have its own folder; activity-specific files go in relevant subfolders.  
  - Example: `Assets/Code/Scripts/SafeWebBrowsing/Activity01/`  
  - Models: `Assets/Models/SafeWebBrowsing/Activity01/`  
  - UI: `Assets/UI/SafeWebBrowsing/Activity01/`  
- Avoid generic names like NewScript.cs or Scene1.unity. Use descriptive names such as LoginManager.cs or SafeWebBrowsing01_Start.unity.

### Script Class Naming / Namespaces

- Use clear and descriptive class names within unique namespaces to prevent conflicts.  
- Each module or activity should define its own namespace:  
  - Example: PasswordSecurity01 for the first activity of the Password Security module.

### Rules and Reminders

- Never push directly to main.  
- All code must go through pull requests.  
- Always merge activity branches into the module branch **before** merging the module branch to main.  
- Pull the latest changes from the base branch before starting or submitting work.
